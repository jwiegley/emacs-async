;;; Commentary:

;; The function, which must be loaded *after* dired-aux.el, performs copies,
;; moves and all what is handled by `dired-create-file' in the background
;; using a slave Emacs process, by means of the async.el module.
;; To use it, put this in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (eval-after-load "dired-aux"
;;     '(require 'helm-async))

This function also handles querying the user, updating Dired

FILE-CREATOR should be a function.  It is called once for each
file in FN-LIST, and must create a new file, querying the user
and updating Dired buffers as necessary.  It should accept three
arguments: the old file name, the new name, and an argument
OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS with the same meaning as in `copy-file'.

OPERATION should be a capitalized string describing the operation
performed (e.g. `Copy').  It is used for error logging.

FN-LIST is the list of files to copy (full absolute file names).

NAME-CONSTRUCTOR should be a function accepting a single
argument, the name of an old file, and returning either the
corresponding new file name or nil to skip.

Optional MARKER-CHAR is a character with which to mark every
newfile's entry, or t to use the current marker character if the
old file was marked."
